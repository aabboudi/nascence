# The Health Benefits of Hiring Professional Janitorial Services for Your Office
There are many reasons to keep your office space clean and presentable. The main reason is that it makes a better first impression on your business affiliates, patients, customers, or clients. While company employees do a reasonable job with everyday cleaning, when professional cleaning services are introduced there are several health benefits that will be added to your office setting. When it comes to creating a safe and healthy workspace, having dependable janitorial services for your business is important.

## Reduces the Spread of Germs
Germs travel quickly in office settings because many people frequently touch shared surfaces. From doorknobs and handrails to elevator buttons to the copier and microwave in the break room, commonly touched surfaces need to be cleaned and disinfected regularly to reduce the spread of germs. One of the most significant health benefits of janitorial services is that they use high-quality, effective cleaning products. With a regular, professional cleaning schedule, you can be assured that your office is as sanitary and germ-free as possible. A cleaner workspace reduces the spread of bacterial and viral illnesses among employees, minimizing sick days and employee absenteeism and increasing productivity.

## Improves Indoor Air Quality
Even under the best circumstances, your office will have dirt, allergens, and dust that build up. Contaminants quickly build up on blinds and drapes, in rugs or carpets, and on high surfaces that employees don't usually clean. Dust may build up, become ingrained in fibers, or be continuously circulated throughout the building by the HVAC system. A dusty environment can negatively affect anyone but may be particularly burdensome to those with asthma, dust allergies, or other breathing issues. Professional janitorial services can clean carpets and blinds, wipe down hard-to-reach areas, and perform other necessary deep cleaning tasks that will remove contaminants and allergens and improve the overall air quality of your office.

## Improves Mental Health
A clean, sanitary, and tidy work area can reduce stress and improve mental clarity for employees. Sometimes an individual may be triggered by a messy environment or knowing that allergens and germs compromise their health in an unclean workspace. In theory, you could delegate cleaning tasks to your staff. However, the increased demand for constant cleaning and sanitizing pulls essential staff members from their primary duties, decreasing workplace productivity and even reducing morale. With routine professional cleaning, you can remove the burden of office cleaning and provide peace of mind for your employees.

## Conclusion
The Nascence Group is committed to quality and provides comprehensive services to support your business. Our janitorial services are tailored to your needs. From supplies to staff, we will work closely with you to provide everything you need. We remove the hassle of keeping a clean office by providing you with fully trained janitorial staff that can provide your employees and clients with an impeccably clean environment. In addition, we use environmentally friendly products and provide a professional experience every step of the way. Contact us today to schedule your consultation and learn more about the health benefit of janitorial services.

# Seasonal Grounds Maintenance: Preparing Your Property for Every Season
Keeping your commercial property looking its best throughout the year requires adjusting your maintenance routine as the weather and typical life cycles of your plants change. Here are some of the most important seasonal landscaping tips to keep in mind when maintaining your lawn throughout the year, many of which The Nascence Group can handle for you!

## Spring
Spring grounds maintenance focuses largely on helping your property recover from any damage that may have occurred during the winter months and working to promote new growth. Once the last of the snow has melted or otherwise been removed from your property, a deep cleaning of your property can be an important step in refreshing its appearance and functionality. Some of the most important steps to incorporate as part of this outdoor spring cleaning can include:

- Removing fallen branches, leftover leaves, and other debris
- Testing your irrigation system, performing any necessary repairs, and programming your system if you want it to automatically come on at certain times throughout the warmer months
- Adding fertilizer and fresh mulch
- Removing weeds and replacing any plants that were significantly damaged during the winter
- Cleaning artificial turf
- Continuing to remove late-season snow and ice as needed

## Summer
Being diligent about grounds maintenance in the summer plays an important role in keeping your lawn and plants healthy and beautiful. You should generally plan to devote more time to regular maintenance during these months to best nourish your greenery, and many of these tasks should be completed as frequently as once per week. Your summer grounds maintenance routine should include:

- Mowing your lawn regularly
- Watering your lawn and plants as needed, especially during weeks with no rain
- Weeding your flower beds and adding mulch as needed
- Trimming or pruning hedges and shrubs
- Treating damage from insects and other pests

## Fall
You generally will not need to spend as much time supporting the growth of your landscape as the weather grows cooler and many of your plants reach dormancy. Still, shifting gears to keeping your lawn clean and preparing it for the challenges of the winter months is an important step in making sure you do not lose all your hard work by spring. Some of the most important things to keep in mind when maintaining your property in the fall include:

- Raking leaves and removing other brush regularly
- Continuing to mow and weed through the beginning of the fall
- Pruning shrubs and trees
- Winterizing your irrigation system to make them less susceptible to damage once temperatures fall below freezing
- Caring for your perennials to best protect them during the colder months
- Fertilizing your lawn

## Winter
Preventing as much potential damage to your property as possible is a key purpose of late fall and early winter maintenance. Your lawn, plants, and other aspects of your property are prone to damage from cold temperatures, snow and ice, snowplows, and other sources during the winter, but being diligent about winterizing the grounds of your business can help to reduce the repairs you need to make in the spring. Some of the most important steps to take when maintaining your property in the winter include:

- Continuing to clean up leaves and other fall debris for as long as you are reasonably able to reduce the amount of cleaning you need to do in the spring
- Pruning shrubs and trees before too much snow arrives
- Watering shrubs, trees, and other plants as needed to make up for receiving less rain during the winter
- Wrapping young or other fragile plants in burlap
- Applying herbicide and fertilizer as needed
- Cleaning up snow and ice as needed, especially on sidewalks and other paved areas

# 5 Advantages of Hiring a Security Guard to Protect Your Business
Hiring a professional security guard is one of the most important safety and security measures you can take to protect your business.

For your business to run as smoothly as possible, your employees and customers need to feel safe, and you need to feel that the business at large is safe from internal and external threats. A well-trained security guard can not only protect your business from threats but also improve your business operations, among other benefits.

## 1. Deter Criminals from Your Business
Having a security guard in your business can deter criminals from attacking your premises, just like having cameras around. People with malicious intent may think twice about robbing a business that has cameras or an armed guard in uniform, knowing they can easily be identified and caught.

In addition, criminals often check the premises they intend to attack for security loopholes they can exploit. Security guards are trained to identify suspicious behavior and can detect potential criminals who are casing your business premises.

## 2. Quick Response to Any Threats Posed to Your Business
Security guards undergo different levels of training in crime response. In the event of an attack on your business, your security guard is in a position to execute a prompt response to the attack, apprehend the criminals, and file an incident report.

During an attack, police response may take several minutes to arrive on the scene. Yet sometimes, all it takes is a split second to save a life. Having a trained security guard in your business eliminates the wait time for police response, as your security guard can mitigate the situation before help arrives.

## 3. Create a Sense of Safety for Employees and Customers
Lucrative businesses are significant targets for criminals, which creates a sense of unease among employees and customers. A good example, in this case, is a bank ATM lobby. Criminals may target people walking into ATM lobbies, knowing they’re carrying cash. This is why ATM lobbies have security guards, helping people feel more at ease walking in and out.

Similarly, having a security guard protecting your business premises will help your employees and customers feel safe from external attackers. The presence of a security guard subconsciously communicates a sense of safety within the premises, knowing any potential issues can be spotted and neutralized.

## 4. Conduct Surveillance Within and Around the Business
Business property can be subject to theft and pilferage from external actors and employees. Statistics show that 30% of business failure is caused by employee theft.

Having trained security guards in your business can help ensure that no one from within the premises leaves with business property, and help prevent unauthorized access to the business premises.

## 5. Enhance Customer Experience and Improve Service Delivery
Professional security guards are trained in communication and customer service because they are a safe contact point for customers who come to your business. Some of your customers are bound to engage with your security guard at some point. Having a trained security guard interact with customers in a professional and friendly manner can improve customer experience and boost service delivery in your business.

# 4 Reasons Every Small Business Needs IT Support
Small businesses are a vital part of the economy, and it's important to ensure they have the resources they need to succeed. One of those essential resources is IT support. IT support can provide small businesses with invaluable assistance when it comes to managing their systems and networks. They can help with technical support and upkeep, diagnosis, and repair of computer hardware, software, and systems.

## 1. Peace of Mind
You can have peace of mind knowing that your crucial business data and systems are in good hands thanks to IT support services. Without IT support, the confidentiality and integrity of the data belonging to your company or your network infrastructure could be at risk for a breach.

## 2. Increased Productivity
By ensuring that computer systems, software, and hardware are current, functional, and error-free, IT support may assist staff members in being more effective and productive. They can minimize downtime, fix issues swiftly, train staff members on new software, and support them in using new technologies, all of which will help them work more productively. 

Furthermore, IT support may enhance teamwork and communication by setting up and maintaining communication systems like email, instant messaging, and video conferencing. 

## 3. Cybersecurity
If your company lacks IT support, it may be subject to cyber attacks, which can cause data breaches, the loss of personal information, and financial damage. With the aid of firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and intrusion prevention systems, IT support services can give your company the know-how and resources it needs to defend itself from online threats. They can also keep an eye on your system for odd behavior and act swiftly in the event of a threat.

Aside from that, IT support may assist your company in putting best practices for cybersecurity into practice, including frequent software updates, backups, and security audits. Additionally, they can offer staff training on spotting and avoiding potential dangers like malware and phishing scams.

## 4. Cost Savings
IT support services can help you save money, over time, by identifying and resolving issues before they become expensive disasters. Even small problems can become major ones without IT help, resulting in expensive downtime, lost productivity, and even data loss.

IT support services are a crucial component for any business, regardless of its size. With IT support, businesses can have peace of mind, increased productivity, improved cybersecurity, cost savings, and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and software.

# 5 Amazing Benefits of Hiring Janitorial Support Services for Your Business
Your office is the physical embodiment of your company. As such, it is important to ensure that your workplace helps you make a great first impression. When it comes to keeping the space clean and sanitary, you can choose to let your in-house employees take on the task or hire janitorial support services. However, professional cleaning services will offer your business numerous benefits and give you better chances of succeeding in your industry.

## 1. Satisfying Cleaning Services
A good commercial cleaning company will have a skilled and experienced team that is capable of delivering a reliable cleaning every single time. Professional janitorial staff will not only bring the right supplies but will also pay attention to detail. The experienced touch from trained cleaners will help to keep your office spotless.

The best cleaning company will take the time to listen to your needs and customize their cleaning services accordingly. Also, you can be sure of getting regular cleaning services once you enter into a contract with a cleaning company. In the end, professional cleaning services are likely to meet your expectations and needs. 

## 2. Leaves A Good First Impression
First impressions matter a lot in business. The appearance of your establishment speaks volumes about what your business can offer. As such, it can influence how clients and customers perceive your business. 

Professional cleaners will help you create and maintain a clean and organized environment. That way, your business will come across as professional and legitimate. This will earn you a positive reputation in the market, effectively helping you to retain your existing customers and attract new ones. 

## 3. Increases Productivity
A clean and well-organized workplace enhances the efficiency of employees and keeps your office running smoothly. Increased productivity will in turn improve your bottom line. 

With janitorial support services, your employees will not have to worry about when they should clean up. This helps to reduce work stress. Similarly, a tidy atmosphere allows staff to operate in a peaceful mood and boosts office morale. This can lead to happier employees, something that will help you retain and attract staff. Lastly, hiring professional cleaners saves you time, effectively freeing you up to focus on your core business. 

## 4. Improves Employee Health
A good cleaning strategy can help to safeguard your employees' health. Healthy employees are happier and more productive. 

Keeping your workplace clean will help to cut down on disease-causing germs, viruses, and bacteria. Trained cleaners will ensure your space is cleaned properly and regularly to keep the environment free from harmful pathogens. When you have a clean workspace, your employees are less likely to fall sick, something that will help you to avoid employees being out often. 

## 5. Provides Long-Term Cost Savings
While it will cost you money to hire cleaning services, working with professionals will save you money on cleaning in the long run. When you have skilled janitors cleaning your business regularly, you will not need major cleaning at any point.

With regular cleaning, office furniture, fixtures and equipment are likely to remain in good condition for longer. As such, cleanliness can save you money on repair and replacement costs. This means that you can rest easy knowing that your workspace is in shape.

# The 5 Benefits of Using a Healthcare Staffing Agency
As a healthcare provider, do you know the benefits of using a healthcare staffing agency to recruit top talent? The healthcare sector attracts much sensitivity and attention when onboarding new employees. An unfilled position or sudden staff shortage can significantly affect your bottom line. With limited time to onboard new employees, a healthcare staffing agency comes in handy by providing gritty details of vetted potential top talent work history.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, healthcare is the fastest-growing industry in the US. Skilled and knowledgeable health workers are in high demand. Regardless of your healthcare facility's needs, a healthcare staffing agency optimizes the hiring and onboarding of new healthcare workers. Here are the top five benefits of using a healthcare staffing agency.

## 1. Access To Top Talent Applicants
You don't want to limit your search to job advertisements alone. Although you will still filter the candidate you think is the best fit based on their CV, they may not be the top applicants. Potential employees who seek job openings via staffing agencies undergo rigorous assessments. As a result, you can rest assured that you will only be seeing candidates with top talent to take your health facility to the next level.

## 2. Diversity of Candidates
In order to find the right person to hire, you’ll need access to a diverse pool of candidates. Using a staffing agency will mean that you’ll be able to choose applicants with different levels of experience based on what the job needs.

## 3. Fill Positions Quickly
When a sudden job opening arises in your company, there is no need to post a job opening, screen applicants, or schedule interviews. You can avoid all recruitment procedures by contacting a healthcare staffing agency because they know the best candidate suited for the role. They’ve already interviewed potential candidates so when a job opens up they’ll have the right person for you vetted and ready to hire.

## 4. Save Time and Money
Hiring staff on your own can be a tedious process. There may be times when you are faced with new projects that require more staff, making you constantly recruit rather than focus on your job duties. Whatever the situation, using a staffing agency saves you time and money. The agency will handle everything so you can focus on the business.

## 5. Flexible to Your Needs
Depending on the position available, you may need full-time, part-time, or seasonal employees. A healthcare staffing agency is flexible to your needs and can help you fill those positions easily. This means your facility will be prepared to deal with future outcomes related to illness, absenteeism, shifts, seasonal fluctuations, and family matters.

# 5 Ways Your Business Can Benefit from Grounds Maintenance
As a business owner, taking care of the physical aspects of your business premises makes a big difference in how your customers and clients perceive your establishment. The pleasing industrial property appearance starts with maintaining or improving your landscaping. Most investors often overlook grounds maintenance, but they end up spending more resources on repairs, installations, and sometimes general landscape renovations. Otherwise, they are likely to lose customers to more appealing businesses.

Ground maintenance can transform your business premise from looking unloved and weary to professional and inviting. Let’s take a look at five ways that your business can benefit from ground maintenance.

## 1. Boosts Curb Appeal
In businesses, the first impression means a lot, and if the outside of your business is not appealing, you will likely have challenges in changing how people think about your company. Unfortunately, once potential customers build a bad experience from the physical outlook, that viewpoint may stick for a long time. However, you can avoid these tarnishing images by maintaining the ground. A well-maintained ground will help you project the right image and boost the reputation that reflects your professionalism.

## 2. Creates a More Welcoming and Inviting Environment
Having a well-maintained landscape is welcoming and aesthetically pleasing. Regardless of the nature of the business, the surrounding area should remain tidy and as inviting as the business itself. You are likely to attract more new customers and retain the existing ones if the ground is welcoming. Litter, overgrown grass, and general untidiness are the greatest enemies likely to keep off your customers, limiting the profit your business could generate.

## 3. Enhance Sustainability
Working with a professional ground maintenance group helps you maintain the local environment, a great way of enhancing sustainability. For example, ground maintenance practices like planting and maintaining an inviting grass cover or planting native prairie grass or wildflower can reduce the amount of runoff that could cause soil erosion and conserves water. Another example is using pest control in your environment to reduce the risks of crop-damaging insects and disease-causing mosquitoes in your neighborhood.

## 4. Helps You Discover Landscaping Issues Early
Untidy and unkempt grounds harbor many landscaping issues, some of which can grow into bigger and more costly problems. Regular maintenance helps you keep an eye on the ground and puts you or your ground maintenance group in a position to spot common problems like dead trees, shrubs, pest infestation, erosion, and waterlogging. These minor issues with time, especially when they go unnoticed, can become a menace and expensive to address.

## 5. Take Pride in the Way Your Business Looks
It’s easy to take pride in your business when the outside looks well kept. Returning customers, employees, and new clients will be welcomed by a tidy and aesthetically pleasing landscape that will provide a welcoming environment time and time again.

# 6 Reasons To Outsource Your IT Staff
Many businesses across various sectors now outsource their IT support to IT service providers for multiple reasons. If you've been wondering whether to outsource your IT support, understanding the benefits can help you make informed decisions.

## 1. Improved Security of Your IT Systems
Many businesses experience data breaches, losses, and hefty fines and penalties due to compromised systems. Online hackers easily access systems and manipulate data for financial gains. Outsourcing IT support to a third-party provider is an ideal way to enhance the security of your IT systems. Third-party providers will help protect your systems against malware and hacking. The provider's job is to keep the systems and software updated and monitor the systems to keep off malicious activities.

## 2. Reduced Operating Costs
When you outsource your IT department to a third party, you do not need to worry about paying salaries, renting office space, or keeping up with other overhead costs. You no longer need to worry about staff turnover and the costs of hiring new employees, training, and maintaining the team. A third party provides services within their premises. This can save you a lot of money in the long run that you can use to develop your business.

## 3. Improved Productivity and Efficiency
Companies that handle their IT in-house often get time to handle other activities. Most spend time on technical tasks to ensure the systems are working efficiently. When a third party handles your IT support, your team will have enough time to focus on the core activities of your business. The team will not have to worry about checking the IT infrastructure and other IT services because a third party has what it takes to handle all the work for you. This gives you peace of mind and relieves the stress of managing the IT system.

## 4. Get High-Level IT Support
An experienced IT third-party service provider understands technology well and can guide you when you need support. Your service provider can train your team on security and other essential elements that improve productivity and efficiency. For instance, your team can be trained on how to identify phishing attempts and what to do to enhance security for their devices. This keeps the team's credentials and business information safe and free from hackers.

## 5. Leverage the Latest Technology
The IT landscape often keeps changing as new solutions emerge. It is imperative to stay updated with the new applications and products to improve the efficiency of your business. An experienced third-party service provider stays updated with the industry trends because technology is their specialty. The third party can help modernize your services and operations. This can give your business an edge over competitors who do not have well-trained teams conversant with security and other vital IT elements.

## 6. Prevent Downtime
IT systems experience downtime, especially when there is no close monitoring and control of the infrastructure. When managed by an IT expert, you will experience efficiency because the expert stays focused on improving the system's operations. The service provider dedicates time to managing your systems and communicates in time if there are any potential risks. This improves overall operations and productivity in the long run.

# How Commercial Janitorial Services Can Help You

Are you looking to hire top janitorial talent? While independent talent searches and job applications allow you first-hand selection, they tend to be overwhelming and time-consuming.

## Qualities That Commercial Janitorial Services Seek

Institutions, such as commercial facilities, corporate businesses, residential services, and healthcare facilities, place an immense focus on health and safety. Therefore, commercial janitorial services are tasked with finding top-notch cleaning staff that meets such expectations.

### 1. Reliability
40% of employers are confident that absenteeism is a major staffing concern with the biggest impact on the cleaning department. As a result, reliability, time-consciousness, and trustworthiness are among the most important skills that a commercial janitorial service expects in cleaning workers.

### 2. Personality
Janitors have a central role in ensuring everyone who enters your business premises enjoys a pleasant experience. This means that they should be friendly and approachable, to ensure that business clientele has a positive experience no matter who they interact with.

### 3. Availability and Flexibility
52% of employers admitted that they need more cleaning staff to keep pace with increased workloads and customer demands. The cleaning industry's unconventional work hours—such as weekend and night shifts—greatly hinder the possibility of hiring workers at the necessary times. Therefore, commercial janitorial services value workers who understand the need for flexibility and are willing to work during these unconventional hours.

## How Commercial Janitorial Support Services Help You Hire New Employees

Due to an organization's hectic responsibilities, devoting time and resources to janitorial staffing can be inconvenient, if not impossible. Fortunately, a commercial janitorial service can handle your staffing needs, allowing you to focus your time and resources on normal business operations.

### 1. Employers Contact The Team
An employer contacts the commercial janitorial service when they need to hire new cleaning staff. The team will then get an understanding of your specific organization’s needs and requirements for the job. The team will also make sure they understand the daily tasks, qualifications, hours of work, and compliance specifications.

### 2. Connect With The Team
Based on the initial call with the team, they will start to put together your staff. After the team has looked at the ideal qualifications and qualities specifically requested by the employers, they are able to select from the janitorial team which workers are best suited for the job. From there, the commercial team will be your main point of contact in managing your janitorial staff, saving you time and money.
